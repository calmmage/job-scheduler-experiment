Idea, what to do for each runner:

- create a sample job
- create a template job
- create a tool to quickly add an arbitrary python job

- [ ] local plist
  - [ ] write a tool to setup job easily
  - [ ] add a helpful alias / docstring to the tool 
  - [ ] Find a way to receive notifications
- [ ] local docker
- [ ] local script runner
